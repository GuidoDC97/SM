Group project consisting in building a Unity application for data visualization. Specifically, the aim of the project is to visualize paths of visitors within the "Museo Archeologico di Napoli (MANN)". 

Detailed description of assignment can be found **[here](/Documentation/Traccia.pdf)**.

## Solution
Project has been completely developed in **C#**, using **Unity**. The complete application developed consists in:
* A **backend** application intended for use by museum operators. With the application they can place/remove/move sensors for tracking visitors.
* A **frontend** application intended for use by museum's management team. With this application they can visualize paths of visitors inside the museum giving a record of paths in input. It is possible to filter the data to visualize based on different criteria and to choose between two possibile kind of visualization.

Front and backend communicates through a central online repository. 

The 3D structure of the museum was built using **SketchUp** and then imported in Unity.
